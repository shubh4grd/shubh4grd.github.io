# Responsive Portfolio
### Responsive Portfolio - Shubham Kumar Burman
A clean and nice web portfolio. That includes almost everything I want to show. At first, name, links to social networks and a great image. Then the About section displays more information about me. Then the list of Skills. It also has a section where it shows some recent work. And at the bottom it has a form, and at the end with a footer. </br></br></br>
